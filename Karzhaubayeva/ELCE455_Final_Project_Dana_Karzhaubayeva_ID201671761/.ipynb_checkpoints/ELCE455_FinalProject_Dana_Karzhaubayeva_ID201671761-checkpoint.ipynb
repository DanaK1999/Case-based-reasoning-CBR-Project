    "Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the classification methods used in machine learning. The main idea of CBR is to use existing solutions to problems to solve similar cases. In other words, the principle of CBR is to find the most suitable solution depending on comparing new and previous cases. In this Fundamental Research project, we described how case-based reasoning works in detail with its mathematics, determined hybrid CBR with other machine learning tools, preference-based and conversational types of CBR, and tried to solve a problem example using that method. As a result, the case-based reasoning classifier was implemented successfully and solved the given problem based on previous cases database.  "

    "Case-based reasoning or CBR is one of the *lazy learners* or *instance-based* methods of classification used in machine learning. Case-based classifier stores training tuples - \"cases\", in the format of complex symbolic descriptions and use previous problem solutions to solve new problems [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between case-based reasoning and other reasoning types is that solution of the previous problem may not be identical to a solution to a new problem. In other words, the solution of the previous case may only be \"*similar*\" or \"*close*\" to the new case solution, which means that case-based reasoning application is a type of approximate reasoning. [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea behind CBR is that *similar problems have similar solutions*. [4]. This similarity concept in CBR refers to the notion of \"most suitable\" or \"very useful\" solutions in finding and using the required one to the new problem from a database of previous cases. Finding a \"most suitable\" or \"very useful\" solution based on comparing new and previous cases is called *similarity assessment*. The comparison consists of *local similarity* and *global similarity* [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "The local similarity is between values of attributes (features) between old and new cases [7]. The global similarity is the overall similarity or summation of local similarities multiplied by a weight of each attribute [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CBR process, after selecting similar cases, their solutions are modified to be the new case solution. Then by detecting an optimal solution to the new problem, a new experience is created. Finally, that new experience is stored in the database of cases solutions for future use, which realize training behaviour [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "CBR has many models which describe its working principles and give a better understanding of the method. For instance, the CBR cycle described by Kolodner and Leake is based on the concept of remembering and adapting. While Aamodt and Plaza's CBR cycle, also called R4, includes retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain processes [4]."
