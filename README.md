Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the classification methods used in machine learning. The main idea of CBR is to use existing solutions to problems to solve similar cases. In other words, the principle of CBR is to find the most suitable solution depending on comparing new and previous cases. In this Fundamental Research project, we described how case-based reasoning works in detail with its mathematics, determined hybrid CBR with other machine learning tools, preference-based and conversational types of CBR, and tried to solve a problem example using that method. As a result, the case-based reasoning classifier was implemented successfully and solved the given problem based on previous cases database.
